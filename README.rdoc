I created the schema below for my app idea that features books and quotes the user has read. I finished adding the show, edit, and delete links to my app for quotes, books, and users.

I had trouble making the "show all quotes" and "create quotes" work. The error kept telling me "quote.user.name" was a nil class. I realized it was because I had created a quote that did not belong to a user. So, every time I tried to show all quotes after creating a new quote, there would be that error message. I fixed the bug with an unless statement.

*Note the "Books" and "See Quotes" on the home page are links.
