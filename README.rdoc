I created the schema below for my app idea that features books and quotes the user has read. I finished adding the Gem Devise, that will allow me to create user log-ins and log outs.

I also had wanted to add the gem filepicker, but I was having trouble configuring it. Since I have three midterms coming up, I didn't have time to figure it out!

*Note the "Books" and "See Quotes" on the home page are links. Also, the lack of images on the home page will change soon once I figure out how to use Gems that will post a random quote and a line of book images from the indexes. :)
