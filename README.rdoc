I added three forms of validation. First, I added a presence validation for book's titles, bodies, and quote's titles. I also added a length validation for books' body at a max of 1500 characters to prevent people from writing extremely long reviews. Finally, I added a uniqueness validation for quotes' titles to ideally prevent people from posting the same quote as someone else.
