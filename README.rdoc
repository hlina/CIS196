I created the schema below for my app idea that features books and quotes the user has read. I finished adding the Gem Devise, that will allow me to create user log-ins and log outs.

I had trouble allowing the user to see the homepage without signing in, and it's because I had an authenticate in the application_controller that blocked everything.
I also had wanted to add the gem filepicker to add images of book posts on my home page, but I was having trouble configuring it. Since I have three midterms coming up, I didn't have time to figure it out, but hopefully I'll add that eventually!
